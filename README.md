# Text Summaries from YouTube Videos
Generate summaries and/or executive reports based on long videos. Reports can be made
from videos that are several hours long, which is great for conferences, academic talks,
lectures, or podcasts. This is accomplished by first creating a summary of the video using 
a specialized LLM, then by using a general purpose LLM To create a report based on the 
summary. 

There are several dependencies that will need to be installed. See the Jupyter notebook for details.
Additionally, you will need an OpenAI API key. 

Beyond that, just supply a YouTube video URL or YouTube playlist URL and run all the cells.
